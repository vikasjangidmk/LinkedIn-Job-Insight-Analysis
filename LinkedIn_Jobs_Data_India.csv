The data landscape is evolving, and at Houseware, we're leading the charge. In the modern business world, data warehouses have become the center of data gravity. Recognizing this shift, Houseware is redefining product analytics by building solutions natively on the warehouse. We eliminate the need for external SaaS vendors and enable businesses to harness the full power of their own data.

Our team comprises seasoned engineers with a track record of building SaaS products for early-stage startups. We thrive on tackling 0->1 problems, have a strong product-thinking approach, and carry a bias toward action.

The Role:

We are hell-bent on building a forward-looking product, something that constantly pushes us to think by first principles and question assumptions, building a team that is agile in adapting and ever curious. While fast-paced execution is one of the prerequisites in this role, equally important is the ability to pause and take stock of where product/engineering is heading from a long-term perspective.

With time, your contribution will grow more on the product and customer use cases, while you still own and make the final decisions on testing setup & frontend stability.

This will require a lot of figuring out on the go with guidance from engineering leaders. We want you to come with that attitude. This will help you strengthen your JS, React, and typescript knowledge, and will take you pretty deep into frontend testing.

Responsibilities:


 * Set up front-end testing framework on Houseware.
 * Identify, design & implement test cases for the most impactful components & flows.
 * Set up processes & guidelines for everyone in the team to follow.
 * Own open-ended problems. Figure solutions, and implementations, and own the releases.
 * Advocate for user experience & best practices in engineering
 * Changes are inevitable in a fast-moving environment; being flexible to changes &; communicating impacts early is of great importance.
 * Last but not least, be in charge of your time, know the impact of your code, and proactively question why we are building this.
   
   

Requirements:


 * You are good at figuring out things on the go. Have an 'I can do, I will figure out' attitude.
 * You have a solid problem-solving framework.
 * You know Javascript very well.
 * You know typescript & fundamentals of React.
 * You have written a few tests in React.
 * You want to go deeper into Js, typescript & react.
 * Care about the user. Care enough to ensure things don't break for them. Care enough to ship the right thing, ship fast, early.
   
   

Nice-to-Have:

 * Flexible and engaging writing style.

The Challenge and Objectives for the Role:

 * The Content & Social Media individual is a highly motivated, creative with experience and a passion for connecting with current and future customers. That passion comes through as he/she engages with customers on a daily basis, with the ultimate goal of turning fans into customers. However
 * We have been seeing a massive shift in what it means to be effective on social media over the last few years. One challenge in this new era of social media marketing is connecting with audiences on an individual and personal level.
 * The good guys at our kitchen are innovating daily so that every dish we make, tastes true to the perfection we strive for. How do we make the world know that through clutter-breaking
 * communication?
 * We nurture not one, not five, but 10+ brands currently. As we scale upwards, the need to communicate at a faster pace becomes obligatory. Managing several channels with an emphasis on quality over quantity becomes a strong operational challenge.
 * Organic reach has been dropping significantly over the years. While marketing spending will always be questioned by shoestring budgets, crafting high-decibel campaigns is the need of the hour.
 * Today, there are 258.27 million active social media users in India. That's nearly one-fifth of the country's total population of 1.3 billion!
 * As social media marketing professionals, we are lucky to reach even .000001% of that population with any one of our posts. This can feel a bit underwhelming for businesses and marketers looking to demonstrate the true value and ROI of social media.




As a Content & Social Media, below are the key expectations from the role:

 * Brand Development: You will have to constantly communicate the - what's in it for me ? - message to the customer through facts, aspirational quotient and cultural context. You will be expected to maintain, scale up and even initiate new social channels for our large kitty of brands. This will include (but not be restricted to) Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Youtube and other growing social networks.
 * Identify target audience: Until you accept the notion that you must keep your market focus tight, you'll constrict your business- ability to grow. Hence you should analytically use data to laser target your message.
 * Solid Content Strategy: Content is still the king in this ever-so-evolving marketing warfront. You should be a good storyteller and devise new content interventions to engage with the relevant online communities.
 * Promotion Strategy: Ensure continued growth of our brands- fan base and promote your content. Social media is now pay to play. Hence Social advertising is a very valuable tool to get your message heard. The right candidate will put great emphasis on quality content and clear messaging to reduce promotion spends and maximize ROI in terms of leads, follower base and engagement.
 * Engagement Strategy: The Social Media manager should listen, respond, ask questions and engage our audience. There should be careful consideration on how he/she responds to organic (non-paid) leads that appear in the comment section of our posts.
 * Measure & Analyze to Establish ROI: Work closely with the Social media lead to measure results on a daily basis. Your results should tie back to your objectives and provide a clear understanding of the returns you are getting. A few points to measure would be Audience Growth, Audience Profile, Audience Engagement, Content Reach, Engagement by Content Type, Leads, Response Rate and Quality, Negative Feedback.




Qualified, Savvy Social Media Managers do not just happen. The Social Media lead will be the voice of REBEL and while social marketing and advertising are an integral part of online marketing strategy, at its heart, social media is about people, conversations and developing leads and sales from those relationships.




Other Specifics :

Skillset :

 * Unlike any other job opening, stating that one must keep an eye on any changes to the media landscape that will influence concepts and make projects innovative and fresh. A professional outlook is also required to handle any strategic change from the brand teams, and meticulous skills will ensure all communication strategies is up to date with algorithm changes and societal changes.
 * One key trait that we would expect you to demonstrate is the spirit of entrepreneurship (one of the most overused words across JDs, though only a few end up living up to it). After all, this is what has enabled building REBEL foods to what it is today and would be essential to help build our brands across these platforms with cut throat competition and clutter of brands.",Full-time,Associate,Marketing and Writing/Editing,Advertising Services,14546143,Mumbai,Maharashtra,Yes

Why we're hiring:




At WPP, technology is at the heart of everything we do, and it is WPP IT’s mission to enable everyone to collaborate, create and thrive. WPP IT is undergoing a significant transformation to modernise ways of working, shifting to cloud and micro-service-based architectures, drive automation, digitise colleague and client experiences and deliver insight from WPP’s petabytes of data.




As we progress on this journey, finance plays a critical partnership role to ensure we deliver an effective transformation by steering project expenditure away from our Operating Companies “OpCo’s” and towards our central departments so that this cost is operationally and financially in line with WPP IT’s strategic goals.




You will lead on the validation and analysis of the baseline volumes, especially the changes in them created by the WPP business over time which culminates in the monthly variable charging element of the new outsourced “Kepler” contract which covers WPP’s Infrastructure, Network, Security and Digital Workplace services globally.

 * Project Work Order (PWO) reviews to ensure value for money and contractually compliant
 * The month-end financial process, constructing journals, reflecting the necessary accruals and prepayment position
 * Ensuring suppliers are paid on a timely basis.




You will also from time to time contribute towards other team objectives such as ad-hoc projects, requests for reporting from the business and feeding management information into relevant programmes and business cases across WPP IT and working with our country hosts in those territories where WPP IT do not have a direct presence.




What you'll be doing:




 * Finance Analyst to our new ‘Kepler’ outsourced IT contract which covers the majority of WPP IT’s services globally.
 * Ensuring you are in control of the monthly and year to date financial implications of the variable charges contained within the Kepler contract.
 * You will challenge volume change data to ensure expenditure is value for money and aligned with WPP IT strategy.
 * You will ensure a finalised jointly agreed billing file is created and signed-off every month.
 * You will review relevant PWO (Project) requests from our OpCo’s to ensure they are in line with WPP IT strategy and value for money.
 * You will develop an understanding of the nature of our OpCo’s requests, so that WPP IT overall has a better understanding of the areas of spend that is occurring locally so that appropriate central programmes can be initiated to cater for areas of consistent need.
 * Work collaboratively with the wider IT Finance team, particularly with the Finance Business Partner teams, FP&A, and the Financial Controllership.
 * Improve data quality, insight, and economic drivers to identify opportunities for efficiency, cost reduction, and ensure every $ spent is value for money for WPP.
 * Assist the Finance Business Partner and Senior Finance Business Partner in their departmental consolidation and business partnering of the Kepler department.
